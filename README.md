Introduction:

Hi! this is another open source project that might be part of something bigger (with that in mind i am trying to organize the files in a different way...)

If you like what you see you can copy and use. But please remember to credit or contribute with me if you like :)
For the moment we are using graphics assets from https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo , Linux mint and Godot Engine.

Everything is open source and free! That's the base of this game anyway.
